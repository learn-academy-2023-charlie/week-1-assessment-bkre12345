# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions


## 1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: 
    Git is a language, whereas Github is a repository of code snippets that uses Git and can be used to share to other devs.

Researched answer: 
    Git is a version control system used to track changes in code. Github is a code hosting platform that uses Git and allows collaboration with other individuals/groups. 

## 2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: 
    The operators === (strict equality), > greater than, < less than, >= greater than or equal to, <= less than or equal to. The logical operators such as && logical AND, || logical OR are the other ones i remember. 

Researched answer: 
    The comparison and logical operators will return a Boolean value. Comparison operators include: === (strict equality), > greater than, < less than, >= greater than or equal to, <= less than or equal to, and the !== not equal value. Logical operators include: && (logical AND), || (logical OR), and ! (logical NOT).

## 3. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: 
    An array's index always starts the count from 0 and also determines an element/characters' location within the array. The values are the datatypes stored in an array.

Researched answer: 
    The index of an array is the position of an element in the array, identified by a numeric value starting from 0. The value of an array is the actual data that is stored at a specific index position.

## 4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different. 

Your answer: 
    Arrays are defined using the [] square brackets, whereas strings are defined using "" quotation marks. Strings are also a primitive datatype which could be used inside an array to group them together. Strings and arrays can both encapsulate numbers and letters, and use commas to separate them if necessary.

Researched answer: 
    Strings are useful for holding data and shown as collection of characters represented in text form. Arrays are a sequential collection of elements and can store any data type, including strings. Arrays are mutable and can be changed dynamically by using built-in methods to add, to modify, or to remove elements, whereas strings are often immutable and can't be changed after it's created. An array's length property returns the number of elements inside the array, while strings's length property returns the number of characters in the string. 
    Both arrays and strings are sequences of data and are objects in JavaScript that have properties and methods. 

## 5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: 
    Proper pair programmaing requires two individuals to work together. In our case, one person is known as the driver and the other is a navigator. The driver's duties are to create the document, or clone from the repo if necessary, and types what the navigator says. The navigator should be helping the driver by telling them what needs to be done and acts as a second pair of eyes to double-checks for any possible errors.

Researched answer: 
    Proper pair programming is a technique in software development where two programmers work together on a task and take turns typing and observing to improve code quality, reduce errors, and promote knowledge sharing and collaboration. The two roles in pair programming is typically divided into a driver and a navigator. The driver is responsible for writing the code and implementing the task, while the navigator is responsible for reviewing the code and providing feedback, and researching and helping to solve any problems that come along. It's important to constantly communicate and switch roles regularly to ensure both programmers have equal input. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: 
    Functions that take other functions as arguments or returns functions as their outputs. It also allows for more flexibility and reusability.

2. Jest:
    A popular JavaScript framework developed by Facebook and was designed to make it easy to write and run tests for JavaScript applications.

3. Objects:
    A fundamental data type that allows storage of collections of related data and functionality such as key-value pairs, where each key is a string or symbol that maps to a value and the values in an object can be any data type.

4. Method:
    A function that is a property of an object; are used to define behaviors of an object and can access and manipulate its properties and values

5. Classes:
    It organizes and structures code by defining object blueprints, or templates to create objects with secific properties and methods. It also allows repeating code that is already defined without having to re-create the same code.
